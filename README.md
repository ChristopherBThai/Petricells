# Petricells
Another side project I am working on. It is a cell simulator were each cell has it's own unique stats. Every time it reproduces, its stats are muted. Its natural environment will weed out the weak, leaving the stronger cells live and reproduce much more.

## The Game
Currently the game is not finished, but is functional. The title screen will have a couple of buttons with a blurred background of these cells.

The game portion consists of many cells that are swarming and struggling to stay alive. They will keep reproducing as time passes. The lack of food and handful of predators will keep the population level steady.

### Types of Cells

There are two types of cells, a herbivores and carnivores. They can be told apart by their teeth and appetite. The herbivores will go after green orbs that spawn throught the map. While carnivores will hunt down the herbivores.

### Cell Reproduction

You can click on each cell to read their stats such as speed, lifetime, sight range, etc.

Everytime a cell reproduces, the stats will mutate, leaving it with similar but different stats. Cells that live longer will reproduce more, leaving the map to be more populated with better stats.
